## 6. Business Logic Explanation

### Core Logic and Features
The Weather Application implements the following core features:
1. Real-time Weather Data Retrieval
   - Fetches current weather data from OpenWeather API
   - Stores weather data in the database for historical analysis
   - Provides formatted weather information including temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed

2. Weather Forecasting
   - Retrieves 5-day weather forecast data
   - Processes and formats forecast information
   - Provides detailed weather predictions for planning purposes

3. Historical Data Analysis
   - Stores and retrieves historical weather data
   - Allows users to view past weather patterns
   - Supports data analysis for specific time periods

### System Behavior and Request Handling
The system follows these request handling patterns:
1. API Endpoints:
   - `/weather/current` - Returns current weather data
   - `/weather/forecast` - Returns 5-day forecast
   - `/weather/historical` - Returns historical weather data

2. Request Processing:
   - Validates input parameters (city, country)
   - Handles API rate limiting and errors
   - Implements proper error handling and response formatting
   - Caches frequently requested data for performance

### Business Rules
1. Data Validation:
   - City and country parameters are required
   - Historical data requests are limited to 7 days by default
   - Temperature is converted to user's preferred units (Celsius/Fahrenheit)

2. Data Storage:
   - Weather data is stored with timestamps
   - Historical data is maintained for trend analysis
   - Database entries include city, country, and weather metrics

3. Error Handling:
   - Graceful degradation when external API is unavailable
   - Proper error messages for invalid requests
   - Database transaction management for data integrity

### Algorithms and Processes
1. Weather Data Processing:
   - Data normalization and formatting
   - Temperature unit conversion
   - Weather condition categorization

2. Historical Data Analysis:
   - Time-based data aggregation
   - Trend analysis for weather patterns
   - Data cleanup and maintenance

3. API Integration:
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Response caching
   - Error retry mechanisms
